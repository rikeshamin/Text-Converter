# Text Clean-up Script

A simple Python script to remove abstract sections from references in a bibliography file and reformat indentation for improved readability and transfer into LaTex. Created for personal use when creating PhD thesis bibliography, however it can be adapted for any text file that requires similar edits. 

Current Features:

* Automatically removes abstract = { ... } and trailing comma. 
* Re-indents entries for consistent formatting.
